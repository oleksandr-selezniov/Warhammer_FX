1) too many setImage() methods. Optimization needed. Remove unnecessary ones and optimize 1-2 best ones (Almost fixed)

2) UI - Test on higher resolutions -> replace all hard-coded numbers with coefficients

3) Refactor mouse listeners in Board.GameCell (hard & risky)

4) Replace highlight for shooting range (was setEffect(new OuterShadow) needed Button filled with color)  - FIXED
4)' Replace innerShadow to outerShadow if mouse on enemy unit (AFTER 4 is done)   - FIXED

5) Create normal attack method

6) Create events and listeners for bottom panel

7) Create classes for EVERY unit. Make Units.Unit abstract.(even if all methods are the same - it's for future use) DEPRECATED

8) do something with image directioning. Humans are always looking to the right, orks to the left. This must be fixed (or at leat make 2 images for each unit, and change them in the right moment)

9999) Think about the rules at last, motherfucker -> change turn-based gameplay
